# Le FACEIT de 13H

The goal of this app is to generate 2 random words that have no relations whatsoever to create a team name for FACEIT.

## History
We are used to play CS:GO PUGs on [FACEIT](https://faceit.com/) with the [Dfuse community](https://dfuse.gg/) between 1pm and 2pm and we needed to look for a name each time we played.

## Rules
- 13 characters max
- Must have 2 words

### Examples 
> ServiceShade  
> FingerScore  
> ShogounCabalÃ©  
> AngletsFormes
